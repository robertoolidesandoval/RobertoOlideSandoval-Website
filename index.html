        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Roberto Olide Sandoval, and I am proud to be a student at UC-Riverside. Currently I am working on earning my bachelor's degree in the business field. I have always wanted to own a business as Itâ€™s something that I find exciting. When I read about entrepreneurs who started with nothing like Walt Disney, it inspires and motivates me as it reminds me that anyone can make it if we put in the effort and dedication. I want to do a few things in the business field, including creating a clothing line and owning a venue.  I hope to someday accomplish this but until then I am always open to new experiences and opportunities. I am the youngest child in my family, and with their support, I hope to become the first generation to graduate from a University. I want to become a role model showing that you can accomplish your goals no matter your background, race, or economic status.
 Some of the programs that I am very familiar with are Photoshop, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, AWS, and Canva. I have used these programs in both school and in my own life whenever I need to get something done. 
I have always tried to give back to my community in ways that I can. I created a GoFundMe called Backpacks for Smiles and advertised it on my personal Instagram account. I even went as far as creating a Youtube channel to do a video where I explained the beginning of all this. I received a total amount of 90 dollars in donations. I bought supplies for boys, girls, and gender-neutral. My brother helped me fill in the backpacks and tag them. When the time came to distribute the backpacks, it felt really heart-warming, and I decided to do it again next year in the summer of 2021. This whole thing took a total of 2 months, which helped me be patient and impacted me by shaping me to be a better me. I also helped an LGBTQ+ organization gather blankets for the homeless as the nights get colder, which I donated more than 40, and even donated a few backpacks for kids. This whole thing helped me learn that any little thing you do can bring a smile to someone else, and itâ€™s always good to give back to the community you love.
